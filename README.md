excel-output-importer
=====================

This repository is largely a public way to share an Excel template--with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripts--for easily reading and refreshing SAS/STATA/R/etc output for table construction.

When working my dissertation around 2007, I had a relatively standard workflow among economists (and many social scientists) of:

1. writing data analysis code in SAS or STATA
2. exporting results out of SAS/STATA either through text-based log files or comma-separated values (csv) tables 
3. reading these tables into excel, and then parsing, rearranging and formating these values for presentation in Excel tables

This process can be very time-consuming across steps 2 and 3, especially while the types of analysis being run are evolving, or even when a given set of analyses are frequently being updated. I found myself being pretty frustrated, and imagined that there had to be a way to cut down on tedious labor, and save my time for more interesting and creative tasks.
